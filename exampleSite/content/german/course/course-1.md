### About Course

Do you want to learn the basics of Dutch? Then this is the right course for you. In this beginnerâ€™s course, we will focus on general language skills (grammar, speaking, reading, writing, listening, spelling and pronunciation). You will learn and practice the basic grammar and language skills you need to provide and ask for simple information in your own words. The goal of this lesson is to be able to understand and use Dutch in common, everyday situations. For example, when:
- meeting new people and introducing yourself, 
- asking for simple information, help or services, 
- following simple directions and instructions; and
- filling out forms and providing basic information.
