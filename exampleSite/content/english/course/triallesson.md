### About Trial Lessons:
Book a trial lesson with me to find out how I can help you achieve your language goals! In the 30-minute lesson we will:
- get to know each other a bit;
- discuss your interests, learning style, goals and needs; and
- develop a learning plan for you based on your specific needs and wishes.

Prior to your trial lesson, you will be sent a contact form and a language level test for a preliminary assessment of your present language skills. This information will give me a better idea of your interests, goals and needs, so I can develop a bespoke learning plan for you.
