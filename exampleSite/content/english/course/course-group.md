### Speak Dutch right from the first lesson!
How can we learn languages fast and efficienctly? By studying and, more importantly, using them in real-life contexts. As a language teacher, I have seen many Dutch learners achieve astoundingly quick results using the tried-and-tested Delft method, which is renowned for its strong focus on communication skills instead of grammar. 

In my group courses, we use this highly communicative method that allows learners to speak right from the first lesson! How? 
* __Before class:__ First, you read and listen to a text extensively and intensively in an e-learning environment. Translations of the text in your native language help you understand the text. Then, you practise your pronunciation and do exercises to prepare for the conversation class.
* __In class:__ All classes are conversation classes taught in Dutch. The class size is limited to 4-6 students to ensure each student gets a lot of speaking practice. We discuss the topic of the text using the words, sentences and structures you have studied at home. If something remains unclear by the end of the lesson, you will have time to ask questions about the text or discuss any uncertainties you may still have.  
* __After class:__ You do a short exam to check whether you have understood everything.  

I currently teach Dutch group courses at levels A0 to B1. The language level required for the Civic Integration Exam(Inburgeringsexamen) and State Exam (Staatsexamen programma I) is B1. 
Are you unsure about your current language level? Or are you interested in taking classes but is your language level B1+?
Feel free to contact me for a placement test or private lessons.     
  
#### Highlights of Group Courses
* __Small classes:__ Get plenty of speaking practice in conversation classes with 4-6 students. 
* __Focus on communication:__ Learn grammar by reading, listening and speaking rather than by studying abstract grammar rules. 
* __Modular courses:__ Set the pace; each course consists of 2 to 4 short modules and it is possible to sign up for one 5-week module at a time. 
* __Fast progress:__ Speak from day one and reach a language level in 20 (A1 or A2) to 40 lessons (A2 to B1).
