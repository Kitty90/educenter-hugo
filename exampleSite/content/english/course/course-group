### About the Courses
I currently offer group courses at language levels A1 and A2. Group courses allow you to share and learn from other students learning journey. The class size will be limited to 3-4 students to provide each student with plenty of speaking practice. The duration of the course depends on the course intensity and the level. Are you not sure which language level you have?

Do you want to learn the basics of Dutch? Then this is the right course for you. In this beginner’s course, we will focus on general language skills (grammar, speaking, reading, writing, listening, spelling and pronunciation). You will learn and practice the basic grammar and language skills you need to provide and ask for simple information in your own words. The goal of this lesson is to be able to understand and use Dutch in common, everyday situations. For example, when:
- meeting new people and introducing yourself, 
- asking for simple information, help or services, 
- following simple directions and instructions; and
- filling out forms and providing basic information.--->
