## ABOUT KITTY
I am an avid language learner and an experienced language teacher and textbook author with an academic background in English (BA), Language Teaching (MA), Educational Technology (MSc) and Education for Sustainable Development.

I come from a tiny town in the Dutch countryside, but have always been intrigued by foreign languages and cultures. After having obtained my degrees in English and Language Teaching, I worked as a secondary English teacher in the Netherlands. However, I moved to Spain in 2016 when I started working remotely for Dutch educational publishers. Eager to learn more about educational technology, I moved to Belgium in 2018 to pursue another master's degree at KU Leuven. I now live in Switzerland, working remotely as a language teacher and educational content developer. Although I no longer live in the Netherlands, I regularly travel home for work, and to see family and friends.
