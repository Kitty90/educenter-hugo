## ABOUT KITTY

I come from a tiny town in the Dutch countryside, but have always been intrigued by foreign languages and cultures. I left the Netherlands in 2016 when I started working remotely for Dutch educational publishers. I have lived in Spain and Belgium and am currently living in Switzerland. Although I no longer live in the Netherlands, I frequently travel home for work, and of course to see family and friends.
