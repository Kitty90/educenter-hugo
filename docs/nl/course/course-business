### About the Classes:
These classes are suited to learners with a low intermediate (B1) to advanced (C1) proficiency level. The lesson content depends on your interests, language level and needs. In these classes, you will study and practice language use in realistic workplace contexts and for a variety of professional purposes, such as:
- job interviews,
- presentations,
- everyday oral communication in the workplace,
- business writing (correspondence, reports, minutes) 

### Teaching Method and Materials:
In each lesson we will study and practice language use in a particular business context or for a specific purpose. In addition, you will be given homework assignments, usually in the form of a scenario-based writing or speaking task that requires you to practice the language functions we studied in class.

I have developed course material for academic and business language use (levels B1 - C1). The materials are generally task-based, focusing on language use in professional contexts. Please do not hesitate to let me know what your specific goals are, so I can tailor my content to your needs.
